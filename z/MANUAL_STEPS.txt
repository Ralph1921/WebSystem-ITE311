MANUAL MYSQL RESET STEPS - NO BATCH FILES NEEDED
=================================================

If you can't run the batch files, do these steps manually:

STEP 1: Open XAMPP Control Panel as Administrator
- Right-click on XAMPP Control Panel
- Select "Run as administrator"
- Stop MySQL by clicking the "Stop" button

STEP 2: Open Command Prompt as Administrator
- Press Windows + R
- Type: cmd
- Press Ctrl + Shift + Enter (this opens as admin)
- Click "Yes" when prompted

STEP 3: Run these commands one by one:

cd C:\xampp\mysql\bin

mysqld.exe --skip-grant-tables --skip-networking

(Leave this window open - MySQL is now running in safe mode)

STEP 4: Open ANOTHER Command Prompt as Administrator
- Repeat Step 2 to open another admin CMD window
- Run these commands:

cd C:\xampp\mysql\bin

mysql.exe -u root

STEP 5: In the MySQL prompt, type these commands:

USE mysql;
UPDATE user SET authentication_string = '', plugin = 'mysql_native_password' WHERE User = 'root';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;

STEP 6: Go back to the first CMD window and press Ctrl+C to stop MySQL

STEP 7: Start MySQL normally
- Go back to XAMPP Control Panel
- Click "Start" next to MySQL

STEP 8: Try phpMyAdmin
- Go to: http://127.0.0.1/phpmyadmin/
- It should work without asking for credentials

If you still get errors, MySQL might need to be reinstalled completely.
