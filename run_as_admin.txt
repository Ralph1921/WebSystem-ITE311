STEP-BY-STEP ADMIN COMMANDS TO FIX MYSQL:

1. Right-click Command Prompt and select "Run as administrator"

2. Run these commands ONE BY ONE:

net stop MySQL92

cd C:\xampp\mysql\bin

mysqld.exe --skip-grant-tables --skip-networking

(This will start MySQL in safe mode - leave this window open)

3. Open ANOTHER Command Prompt as administrator and run:

cd C:\xampp\mysql\bin

mysql.exe -u root

4. In the MySQL prompt that appears, type these commands:

USE mysql;
UPDATE user SET authentication_string = '', plugin = 'mysql_native_password' WHERE User = 'root';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;

5. Go back to the first Command Prompt and press Ctrl+C to stop MySQL

6. Run this command:

net start MySQL92

7. Test if it works:

mysql.exe -u root -e "SELECT 'SUCCESS!' as Result;"

If you see "SUCCESS!" then it worked!

ALTERNATIVE: Just run the PowerShell script:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\xampp\htdocs\ITE311-TERRADO\fix_mysql_auto.ps1"
